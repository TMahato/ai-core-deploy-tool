What process.exit(0) Does

process.exit(0) forcibly ends the Node.js process and returns an exit code (0 = success).

Think of it as saying:

“I’m done — stop everything now, clean up, and exit successfully.”

🧠 Why You Need It Here

In your script:

await openNewTerminalAndRunCommand();
process.exit(0);


You’re calling asynchronous functions (inquirer.prompt, spawn, readline) that:

Open new subprocesses (terminal),

Create event listeners (rl.question, terminalProcess.on('error')),

Keep Node's event loop active even after your main logic completes.

Normally, Node.js will automatically exit when the event loop is empty —
but if any of the following remain open:

a readline interface,

a pending stdin listener,

a spawned detached process with an unreferenced handle,

or even a timer or promise waiting,

then Node.js stays alive indefinitely.

✅ So by calling process.exit(0), you’re saying:

“Ignore any leftover async listeners — just exit cleanly when my main workflow is done.”
